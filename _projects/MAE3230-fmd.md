MAE 3230 Fluid Dynamics Final Project, Fluid Mechanical Dissection.

Our group, consisting of myself, Kat Volkova, Olivia Tolliver, and Kyra McCarrick, dissected a leaf blower to see how it works and apply conceps we learned in class to understand its fluid mechanical underpinnings. We created a video to document our findings.

My contributions to the video consisted of script writing, voice over recording, and being the primary person documenting the dissectiton process. I also helped with some of the behind the scenes aspects of the carburator/venturi mathmatical sidebar. All four of us were activly participating in the manual aspects of the dissecting the leaf blower, so there is no good way to separate specific contributions for that component.
